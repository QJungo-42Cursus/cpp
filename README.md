**Is C enought ?**

*C with classes, or C++ is a pretty interesting programmation language 
but I have to admit that it fells like over the year the maintainers added everything went in ther minds.
I have a huge preference for the Rust programming language who seems to take all the good parts of C++.*

This 42 Cursus project is a set of exercice to introduce C++ and OOP. This was pretty straight forward in term of logic (0 algo) but a bit
disturbing with how class work in C++.
