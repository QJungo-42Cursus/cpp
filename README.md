**Is C enough ?**

*C with classes, or C++ is a pretty interesting programming language, 
but I have to admit that it feels like over the year the maintainers added everything went in therm minds.
I have a huge preference for the Rust programming language who seems to take only the good parts of C++.*

This 42 Cursus project is a set of exercises to introduce C++ and OOP. This was pretty straight forward in terms of logic (0 algo) but a bit
disturbing with how class work in C++.
